# family-tree
app to describe my family tree to people I want

# ToDo
* make a better Readme :)
* unit tests for the store
* unit tests for the components (enzyme?)
* ~~use a localization library~~ (did manually)
* ~~read data file from server~~
* ~~cache data file from server in local storage~~
* ~~cache images~~
* metrics
* lint

I might just release without automated tests. I want to see if people will like/use it :)
